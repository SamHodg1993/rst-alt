                <p className='about-text'>This picture shows a portion of our current fleet lined up at Truckfest Ingliston 2022. We have a modern fleet, we tend to trust 
                        Daf and Mercedes trucks, although if you have a keen eye then you might spot our new Renault T-High or our new Iveco. At RST we are proud of our 
                        working vehicle fleet and love to keep them looking good. Our drivers are enouraged to make their trucks their own and can generally pimp their rides with lights and interior 
                        furnishings so they can live in style and comfort while out down the road.</p>

                            We have came a long way from then though, pictured here is the first truck in the RST fleet, the Mercades Atkins Roberts pride and joy, 
                            on a sunny day on the lead up to truck show season, if you are lucky, you may see Robert pollishing this beauty up.</p>

                        site in Glasgow. Out drivers are skilled in all kinds of deliveries, we are always looking for the next challenge here at Summers.</p>
